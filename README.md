## Introductiom

This is a power BI project on sales analysis of an imaginary store called **Global Superstore**.
The aim of the project is to analyze and drive insight to answer crucial questions and help the store to make data driven decisions.

**_Disclaimer_**: _All dataset and report do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of Power BI._

## Problem Statement

1. a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014? b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?
2. Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.
3. Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries? 
4. Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia. Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
5. a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. b) Why is this city’s average profit so low? 
6.  Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia? 
7.  Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?

## Skills and concepts demonstrated

The following power BI features were incorporated:
- Power query
- DAX
- Modelling
- Visualization

## Data Transformation and cleaning

Merged tables, Deleted column (80% empty), Created 3 dimension and fact table for easy data modelling, Changed data type.

## Data Modelling

Automatically derived relationships were adjusted and replaced with the required relationship.
There are 3 dimension and 1 fact tables and the dimension tables were joined to the fact table using the one-to-many relationship.
